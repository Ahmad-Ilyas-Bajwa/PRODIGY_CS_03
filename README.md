This tool is designed as part of an internship task in Cyber Security at Prodigy InfoTech.

This project is a password complexity checker tool developed using Python. The tool evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria, including the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, numbers, and the overall length of the password. It provides real-time feedback and suggestions for improving the password strength.

Prerequisites
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

How It Works
The program evaluates the password based on the following criteria:
- Length: Password should be at least 8 characters long.
- Uppercase Letters: Password should contain at least one uppercase letter.
- Lowercase Letters: Password should contain at least one lowercase letter.
- Numbers: Password should contain at least one numeric digit.
- Special Characters: Password should contain at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).
